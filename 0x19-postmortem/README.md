# Postmortem Report: Outage Incident on August 17, 2024

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: August 17, 2024, 10:00 AM - August 17, 2024, 12:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact**: The API service experienced significant slowdown with response times exceeding 60 seconds. Users encountered timeouts and errors when accessing the service. Approximately 50% of users were affected.
- **Root Cause**: The outage was caused by a sudden spike in traffic that overwhelmed the load balancer, leading to high latency and timeouts.

## Timeline
- **10:00 AM**: Issue detected through a sudden increase in response times and error rates reported by the monitoring system.
- **10:05 AM**: Alerts triggered and verified by an engineer who confirmed the slowdown.
- **10:15 AM**: Initial investigation focused on the API server's performance metrics, but no anomalies were found.
- **10:30 AM**: Misleading investigation paths included checking database performance and network latency, which were not related to the root cause.
- **11:00 AM**: Incident escalated to the senior DevOps team to handle the increased traffic and load balancer configuration.
- **11:30 AM**: The root cause was identified as insufficient capacity in the load balancer to handle the traffic spike.
- **12:00 PM**: Load balancer settings were adjusted, and additional resources were allocated to handle the increased traffic. The service performance returned to normal.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause**: The load balancer was configured with inadequate capacity limits for handling high traffic volumes. This configuration led to a bottleneck, causing the slowdown and timeouts in the API service.
- **Resolution**: The load balancer configuration was updated to increase capacity limits and handle higher traffic volumes. Additionally, auto-scaling rules were adjusted to dynamically allocate resources based on traffic patterns.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Improvements/Fixes**:
  - Enhance load balancer configuration to handle anticipated traffic spikes more effectively.
  - Implement auto-scaling policies to automatically adjust resources based on real-time traffic data.

- **Tasks**:
  1. **Patch Load Balancer**: Update the configuration to increase capacity and optimize traffic distribution.
  2. **Implement Auto-Scaling**: Set up and test auto-scaling policies to handle traffic spikes without manual intervention.
  3. **Review Monitoring Alerts**: Fine-tune monitoring alerts to detect and respond to high traffic situations more promptly.
  4. **Capacity Planning**: Conduct regular capacity planning reviews to ensure infrastructure can handle peak loads effectively.
